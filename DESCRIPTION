Description: The KONP tests are powerful non-parametric tests for comparing K (>=2) hazard functions based on right-censored data (Gorfine, Schlesinger and Hsu, 2019, <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.05739v1.pdf>). These tests are consistent against any differences between the hazard functions of the groups. The KONP tests are often more powerful than other existing tests, especially under non-proportional hazard functions.
